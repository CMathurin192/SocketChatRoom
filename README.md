# SocketChatRoom
A chat room open to two members made with sockets in Python. Made for fun and experience.

This chat room was originally going to support up to 10 people, which could easily be implemented, but
I kept running into "ConnectionAbortedError: [WinError 10053] An established connection was aborted by the 
software in your host machine" when trying to test with the 3rd chat room member. I could not find a solution
to this error, so I decided to just keep it to two members.
